# SIH_META_MINDS
This MATLAB code simulates rail defect detection using acoustic and ultrasonic sensor data, comparing signals with and without the presence of cracks. It also includes a predictive analysis to estimate when track maintenance is needed and when a detected crack may become a major safety threat.
